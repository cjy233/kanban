Feature #40 done. Added a global keydown listener in `App.vue` that handles:

- `1` → navigate to dashboard
- `2` → navigate to processes
- `/` → focus the search input on the processes page
- `R` → click the refresh button
- `Escape` → blur any focused input

Shortcuts are ignored when the user is typing in an input, textarea, or select. Build and smoke test both pass. All 40 features are now complete.
