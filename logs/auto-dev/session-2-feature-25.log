Feature #25 done. Changes:

- `style.css` — added `[data-theme="dark"]` block with dark palette CSS variables and a `--color-chart-grid` variable
- `App.vue` — added theme toggle button in nav, localStorage read/write, `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`
- `Dashboard.vue` — chart grid color reads from CSS variable, MutationObserver updates charts when theme changes

Build and smoke test both pass. Committed as `fae5caf`.
